    "\n",
    "Here's how the filter method works in general:\n",
    "\n",
    "1:Calculate the correlation or mutual information between each feature and the target variable.\n",
    "2:Rank the features according to the correlation or mutual information score, where higher scores indicate stronger relationships with the target variable.\n",

    "5:Some commonly used statistical measures for feature selection using the filter method include Pearson correlation coefficient, chi-square test, information gain, and mutual information. The filter method is fast and efficient, and it can be applied to large datasets with many features. However, it may not take into account the dependencies among the features, and it may miss important interactions between features that are necessary for accurate predictions.\n"
